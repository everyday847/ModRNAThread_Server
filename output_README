Here is a quick explanation of each file that was contained in this zip file.

start.pdb:   The pdb submitted to the server, converted into rosetta format.

S_000*.pdb:  The finished, threaded conformation for each round. The number at the end signifies which round it came from. Each round is unique, so ordering does not matter.

summary.txt: The summary of the rosetta energy and RMSD for each round.
